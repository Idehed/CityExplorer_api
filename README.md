## Objective
This is the API for the SourdoughCircle FrontEnd application.
Here the backend information such as users, profiles, posts, comments, likes, categories etc are stored.

### React Frontend
The repository for the frontend of the application can be found here:<br>[CityXP FrontEnd]()

## Live Page

# Planning and Agile

## Design:

## Wireframes:
### Homescreen/Feed

## Agile:
The API and Frontend of this project was planned using Agile methodology and MoSCoW prioritization on github projects.<br>

The user stories project can be found [here]() 

## Labels used:
`must have`
`should have`
`could have`
`wont have`

<b>The issues were closed and the milestones subsequently too.</b>

## Relationship Diagram
The relationship diagram between models from an individual perspective can be best defined as follows:

- The [Profile]() flaunts the owner(OneToOne),<br>
 created_at(DateTimeField),<br>
 updated_at(DateTimeField),<br>
 name(CharField),<br>
 email(EmailField),<br>
 content(TextField),<br>
 image(ImageField),<br>
 facebook_link(URLField),<br>
 twitter_link(URLField) and<br>
 instagram_field(URLField)<br>

## Methodology CRUD
When performing CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) function based views, the following methods were used to manipulate the table in the database.

For such, to the subsequent endpoints:
/profiles/, /posts/, /comments/, /likes/, /followers/, /contact/, /category/

- POST - Used to create an object to a list of (endpoint)
- GET - Used to retrieve series of objects from a list of (endpoint)

Singularly, for the same endpoints past the primary keys:
/profiles/int:pk/, /posts/int:pk/int:pk/, /comments/int:pk/, /likes/int:pk/, /followers/int:pk/, /contact/int:pk/, category/

- GET - Used to view a single object in a list or (endpoint)
- PUT - Used to update a single object in a list of (endpoint)
- DELETE - Used to delete an existant single object from a list of (endpoint)

Users can then:
- CRUD Profiles
- CRUD Posts
- CRUD Comments
- CRUD Likes
- CRUD Followers
- CR Contacts


## Features and Functionality for Superusers

As a Superuser one has the ability to perform the following via the admin panel:
- CRUD Posts
- CRUD Comments
- CRUD Profiles
- CRUD Contacts
- Change Passwords
- Change emails
- Promote users to Superuser

# Manual Testing

Manual Testing for the overall functionality of the API was performed by entering dummy data in the backend both via Backend-and Front-end.
All data is CRUDed accordingly.<br>
<b>[Detailed manual testing is located here](/Testing.md)</b>

## Validation
CI Python Linter was also used in parallel with the development of the API, to keep the code free of errors.

The Code has not exhibited apparent errors after consecutive tests and corrections throughout the development.
Minor errors was appearing in the validation but was simple to resolve:
