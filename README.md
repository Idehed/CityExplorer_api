## Development Goals
The goal of this API is to store backend data for the CityEP FrontEnd application.
Here the backend information such as users, profiles, posts, comments, likes, guide, reviews are stored. And all is CRUD functioned.

### React Frontend
The repository for the frontend of the application can be found here:<br>[CityXP FrontEnd](https://github.com/Idehed/cityexplorer-frontend)

## Live Page

# Planning and Agile

## Wireframes:
Wireframes can be seen here in the Frontend: <br>[CityXP FrontEnd](https://github.com/Idehed/cityexplorer-frontend) 

## Agile:
The API and Frontend of this project was planned using Agile methodology and MoSCoW prioritization on github projects.<br>

The user stories project can be found [here](https://github.com/users/Idehed/projects/6) 

## Labels used:

    - Must Have 
    - Should have  
    - Could have
    - Future implementation
    - Won't have
This projects user stories was divied into 9 milestones , "Authentication", "Navigation", "Posts", "Profile", "Comments", "Likes", "Contact", "Guides" and "Followers". All the user stories has been labeled and assinged to the developer and some labels has been put later such as "won't fix" and "Future implementation".

<b>All the issues were closed and the milestones subsequently too.</b>

## Database Design

## Methodology CRUD
When performing CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) function based views, the following methods were used to manipulate the table in the database.

For such, to the subsequent endpoints:
/profiles/, /posts/, /comments/, /likes/, /followers/, /guides/, /reviews/

- POST - Used to create an object to a list of (endpoint)
- GET - Used to retrieve series of objects from a list of (endpoint)

Singularly, for the same endpoints past the primary keys:
/profiles/int:pk/, /posts/int:pk/int:pk/, /comments/int:pk/, /likes/int:pk/, /followers/int:pk/, /guides/int:pk/, /reviews/int:pk/

- GET - Used to view a single object in a list or (endpoint)
- PUT - Used to update a single object in a list of (endpoint)
- DELETE - Used to delete an existant single object from a list of (endpoint)

Users can then:
- CRUD Profiles
- CRUD Posts
- CRUD Comments
- CRUD Likes
- CRUD Followers
- CRUD Guides
- CRUD Reviews

## Features and Functionality for Superusers

As a Superuser one has the ability to perform the following via the admin panel:
- CRUD Posts
- CRUD Guides
- CRUD Profiles
- CRUD Contacts
- Change Passwords
- Change emails
- Promote users to Superuser




# Manual Testing

Manual Testing for the overall functionality of the API was performed by entering dummy data in the backend via Backend-end.
All data is CRUD functioned.
Create, Read, Update and Delete.
Screenshots have been taken to display that everything is working as expected.<br>
<b>[Detailed manual testing is located here](/Testing.md)</b>


## Validation
CI Python Linter was also used with the development of the API, to keep the code free of errors.

Minor errors was appearing in the validation but was simple to resolve:

    - E501 line to long (85 > 79 characters)
    - E225 missing whitespace around operator   
    - E128 continuation line under-indented for visual indent
    - E122 continuation line missing indentation or outdented
    - E111 indentation is not a mutiplie of 4
    - E117 over-indented
    - E302 expencted 2 blac lines,found 1
    - W292 no newline at end of file

I had one that i could not fix and it was this one, i tried with everything but all outcome was line to long.

## Future Improvements
<b>Contact page</b><br>
I did not have enought time to implement the contact page so that is one thing to improve the website.
<b>Notification</b><br>
Notification for the user if someone has likes, commented or followed you would be nice to have.
<b>Django-resized</b>
Would add the django-rezsized for both profile model and post model for impreved performace.
<b>Edit guide</b>
Would be nice to have the function to be able to edit your guide information.
<b>Delete reviews</b>
The option to delete your review if you for some reason have changed your mind or a guide.

- Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to 
  fork.

- On the top right of the page under the header, 
  click the fork button.

- This will create a duplicate of the full 
  project in your GitHub Repository.
